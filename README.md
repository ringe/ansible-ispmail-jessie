# ISPmail Jessie Ansible Playbook #

This repository contains a playbook and roles that you can use to set up your own Debian-based mail server. Please follow the instructions at https://workaround.org/ispmail/jessie/ansible

This repository is a clone of https://git.workaround.org/chaas/ansible-ispmail-jessie.git

# Requirements #

- Vagrant (for testing) and VirtualBox
- [Ansible](https://ansible.com)

  necessary.
